## 👋 About This Project

Hi! I'm a student passionate about web development and music. This project is a Spotify-inspired music app clone, created as part of my learning journey in React, TypeScript, and modern frontend tools. It is for educational purposes only and not intended for commercial use.

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- Practice building a full-featured React app
- Learn about component-based architecture and state management
- Explore modern tools like Vite and Tailwind CSS
- Understand routing and UI/UX best practices
- Simulate real-world app features (search, playlists, player controls)

## 🚀 Features

- 🎧 **Music Player**: Play, pause, skip, and like songs with a sleek player bar.
- 📚 **Playlists & Albums**: Browse, view, and play from curated playlists and albums.
- 🔍 **Search**: Instantly search for songs, albums, and playlists.
- 🏷️ **Categories/Genres**: Explore music by mood, genre, or category.
- 🖥️ **Responsive UI**: Works beautifully on desktop and mobile.
- ⚡ **Fast & Modern**: Built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Routing:** React Router
- **State:** React Hooks
- **Mock Data:** Local TypeScript files

## 📦 Getting Started

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Gitanjali-Yadav/spotify-2.O-using-React.git
   cd spotify-clone
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install

## 📝 Project Structure

```
.
├── components/      # Reusable UI components (PlayerBar, Sidebar, AlbumCard, etc.)
├── pages/           # Main app pages (Home, Playlist, Search)
├── constants.ts     # Mock data for songs, albums, playlists, categories
├── types.ts         # TypeScript interfaces for core entities

## ⚠️ Notes

- This project uses mock data only. No real music/audio streaming or backend integration.
- For a real app, you’d need to integrate with a music API (e.g., Spotify Web API) and add authentication.
- This project is for educational/demo purposes only and is not affiliated with Spotify.
